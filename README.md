# FastAPI_Edu

## Welcome to my FastAPI project!
This project is a study of mine to learn on how to use FastAPI. Simple as that.

### Requirements
- Python 3.12 above

### Quick notes
- This application has Swagger and Redoc
- To access one of them just type:`localhost:8000/docs` or `localhost:8000/redoc` on the browser.

### Installing
- First, create your enviroment with `python -m venv .venv`
- Secondly, run the enviroment `(Linux) . .venv/bin/activate // (Windows) source .venv/Scripts/activate` and then install the packages with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Last but not least, run the application with `task run`, and to run tests use `task test`.
PS: to see the coverage fully detailed just run `task post_test`
